Introduction to GIT

1. Go to github.com and create a new repository.

2. Launch GIT Bash on Windows and go to the folder that you want to connect to that repository.

3. Run the following command to initialise the repository

	git init

	This creates a folder .git with some files in it.

4. Type "git status" to check that things are OK.

5. Create a test file (e.g., test.txt) 

6. Connect your folder to the git repository at github.com. Use the following command:

	git remote add origin git@github.com:amathenge/testrepo.git

	This assumes that the repository I created is called "testrepo"

Note: since I'm using SSH on this machine, I used the "git@github.com..." syntax. The connection 
can also be created by typing the following:

	git remote add origin https://github.com/amathenge/testrepo.git

With both, you'll be asked for credentials. With the "@" syntax, you'll be asked for the SSH key passphrase.
For the https syntax, you'll be asked for the password to github.com

7. Now add the file you created (test.txt) to the list of files to be tracked:

	git add test.txt

You can also add all the files in the folder by typing:

	git add .

8. Commit the file(s)

	git commit -m "Initial version"

	The comment is a MUST

9. Push the files to the remote repository

	git push

You can also push a single file.

Note: if you made a mistake and don't want a file committed, you can un-commit by

	git reset --soft HEAD^
	or
	git reset --soft HEAD~1

	then

	git reset HEAD /path/to/file

	then

	git commit -c ORIG_HEAD

The last command is if there were files to commit.
